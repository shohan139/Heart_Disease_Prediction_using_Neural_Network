# Heart Disease Prediction using Neural Network
This project will focus on predicting heart disease with the help of neural networks based on different attributes of patients.
<br>
<br>

<b>Dataset: </b>The dataset that has been taken from UCI. The link is <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease">here</a>
The description of the dataset also can be found in the UCI.
<br><br>

A simple neural network with one hidden layer has been defined using keras for categorical classification. In the final layer of the network, softmax activate function has been used and categorical_croosentropy loss has been used in the training phase.
<br><br>
For the binary classification, adam optimizer has been used.
